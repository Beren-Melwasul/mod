Galadriel, Celeborn, and Amroth
===================================
Amroth was originally the son of Galadriel and Celeborn, During the late 2nd and early 3rd age, Galadriel and Celeborn dwelth in Dol Amroth, near Edhellond. The area was called 'the country of Amroth where the Nandor Elves still dwell' in 'Adarion and Erendis', which implies the name pre-dates the death of Amroth (because the tale of his death makes clear that Edhellond was in it's last gasp). Amroth became King of Lorinand early, but often visited his parents.

Later, this was dropped. After the destruction of Eregion, Galadriel went to Lindon and Celeborn went to Lorinand temporarily. However, this leaves unquestioned the problem of where Galadriel and Celeborn were for almost 3500 years afterwards, and why/how Dol Amroth and 'the country of Amroth' was named (for an Elf-King who only visited the area once, to die, 2 thousand years after it was established as a Númenorian/Gondoran stronghold).

So, my history:
• Late 1st age or early 2nd age: G & C 'pass over the mountains' and organize a 'realm' by Lake Nenuial.
• Later, Eregion is founded by a group of mostly Noldorin lords and ladies, including G & C. Annatar (Sauron) arrives and 'befriends' most the Eregion Nobility (including Celebrimbor, thier chief), but Galadriel declines, gets upset and abandons Eregion, moving to Lorinand. She gets a barony.
• Thr War of the Elves and Sauron. Eregion is destroyed, with Celeborn and many refugees moving to Lorinand via Khazad-dûm. As Lorinand is likely to come under attack, Amdír sends Amroth south with many refugees down the Anduin (and causing trouble in Sauron's rear). The pre-existing realm of Edhellond grows in size and population, and after the previous ruler decided to sail west, Amroth becomes the new ruler.
• Lorinand and Khazad-dûm come under assault by Sauron, with Galadriel and Celeborn aiding in the defence. After it is done, Celeborn gets a county, but Galadriel has sea-longing, so she heads to Edhellond. She gets a county there.
• After the downfall of Númenor, Edhellond has decreased in population, so Dol Amroth is given to the Faithful.
• After the Final Alliance war, Amroth takes up the kingship of Lorien, and Galadriel gets a county there, dropping the depopulated county near Edhellond (to gondor).
