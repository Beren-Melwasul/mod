EVTDESCdwarfconq.11;Azanulbizar, where Durin the Deathless came to Khazad-dûm and saw his crown in Kheled-zâram, is held by evil forces. With Durin's Bane gone, many feel that now is the time to take Azanulbizar, and use it as a base to reconquer Khazad-dûm. Taking back Khazad-dûm will likley require an enormous and long seige. Without Azanulbizar as a base, our army will wither. Shall we launch the war?;;;;;;x
