EVTTITlastalliance.0;Forming an Alliance;;;;;;x
EVTDESClastalliance.0;The evil that corrupted Númenor and led it to it's destruction is not gone, for the Evil Empire of Mordor has been rebuilt, and menaces the Free Peoples of Middle_earth. You feel that perhaps now is the proper time to form a grand alliance of the Free Peoples, to take down Mordor once and for all!\nDo you send messengers to the other leaders of the Free Peoples of Middle-Earth asking them to join?;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlastalliance.0;Yes, send the messengers at once!;;;;;;x
TT_MEP_LASTALLIANCE0_SENDMESSAGE;You send messages to the leaders of the Free Peoples asking them to join your alliance.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlastalliance.0;No, perhaps later.;;;;;;x
EVTTITlastalliance.1;An Anti-Mordor Alliance;;;;;;x
EVTDESClastalliance.1;You have received a messenger from [From.GetTitledFirstName], proposing a Grand Alliance against the forces of Mordor. This seems worthwhile, but you would have to abandon any wars against fellow Alliance members.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlastalliance.1;Yes, I will join! Mordor must be dealth with!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlastalliance.1;No, I don't like [From.GetTitledFirstName] enough.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTClastalliance.1;Too bad [From.GetTitledFirstName] has died.;;;;;;x
EVTTITlastalliance.2;A new Alliance Member;;;;;;x
EVTDESClastalliance.2;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], your cause is my cause, and down with Mordor! I, [From.GetTitledFirstName] will gladly join your Alliance!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlastalliance.2;Wonderful!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlastalliance.2;Too Bad I'm DEAD!;;;;;;x
EVTTITlastalliance.3;A Rejection of the Alliance;;;;;;x
EVTDESClastalliance.3;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], I am afraid that I, [From.GetTitledFirstName], will not be joining your proposed Alliance.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlastalliance.3;[From.Get] is a Fool;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlastalliance.3;I'm DEAD, so what!;;;;;;x
EVTTITlastalliance.5;Finalizing the Alliance;;;;;;x
EVTDESClastalliance.5;Your attempts to found an Anti-Mordor alliance have been a success, with the ruler of the Noldor, as well as other Leaders, joining you. It is time to bring an end to any wars among members of the new alliance, and afterwards, the Alliance can launch an attack!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlastalliance.5;Yes, do so.;;;;;;x
TT_MEP_LASTALLIANCE5_MAKEPEACE;All members of the Alliance stop any existing wars between them and declare non-aggresion pacts.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlastalliance.5;A major alliance leader has died, stopping things.;;;;;;x
EVTTITlastalliance.6;The Alliance Has Failed;;;;;;x
EVTDESClastalliance.6;Your request to other leaders have failed to produce enough supporters. The Anti-Mordor alliance is stillborn, although those few who have joined will still be allied with you for a while.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlastalliance.6;How dissapointing;;;;;;x
EVTTITlastalliance.7;The Alliance is aborted.;;;;;;x
EVTDESClastalliance.7a;You have agreed to join the Anti-Mordor Allaince of [From.GetTitledFirstName], but unfortunatly, [From.GetHeShe] has not gotten anough participants to make the Grand Alliance viable. You are still with [From.GetHerHim] in a lesser alliance, though.;;;;;;x
EVTDESClastalliance.7b;You have agreed to join the Anti-Mordor Allaince of [From.GetTitledFirstName], but unfortunatly, [Root.GetName] has died, aborting the project.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlastalliance.7;This is bad;;;;;;x
EVTTITlastalliance.8;The Grand Alliance;;;;;;x
EVTDESClastalliance.8;The Grand Alliance has now been formed, and will likely soon attack Mordor. As a participant, any wars you might have had with other Alliane members have now been halted.;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlastalliance.8;So be it.;;;;;;x
last_alliance_attack;Attack Mordor;;;;;;x
last_alliance_attack_desc;With the Anti-Mordor Alliance in place, you can use this event to launch the attack!;;;;;;x
EVTTITlastalliance.10;Attack Mordor?;;;;;;x
EVTDESClastalliance.10;With the Anti-Mordor Alliance formed, do you think now is the time to declare war?;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlastalliance.10;Yes, declare war!;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlastalliance.10;Mayhaps later.;;;;;;x
