I will do all the dates starting from when the elves were awakened by Eru Illuvatar.  They were awoken in 4550 Y.T. by count of the trees of Valinor.  This will be called year 1, the first year of the First Age of the Children of Illuvatar.  There are 9.582 sun years in each Y.T. year, so altogether in the first age (before the sun) there are 4311.9 years.  I will count this as 4312 years in the first age, before the sun.

After the sun there are 590 years of the First Age.

There are 3441 years in the 2nd age.

There are 3021 years in the 3rd age.

1st Age = 4312+590 = 4902
2nd Age = 3441
3rd Age = 3021

So for a first age date (after the sun)
we do 4312 + date

For first age date (before sun) we take the date and times it by 9.582 and round it to the nearest whole number

For 2nd age date we add the date to 4902 years

For 3rd age date we add the date to 8343 years

F.A. before sun = y*9.582

F.A. after sun = y+4312

S.A. = y+4902

T.A. = y+8343

F.A. = y+11364 #fourth age!

y=date

In conclusion, the year 3000 of the third age is actually year 11343 in game time.
